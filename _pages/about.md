I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Bauerle Root Ecophsiology lab under Dr. Taryn Bauerle. Currently, I am exploring questions pertaining to root exudate chemistry and root exudate interactions. Prior to arriving to Cornell, I completed a M.Sc. at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Dr. Amaya Atucha focusing on the effect horticultural practices have on cold-climate interspecific hybrid grape and wine varieties.    

Beyond the academic realm, I was an avid runner and did a few ultra-marathons (I am too old and tired now). I enjoy singing, gardening, refurbishing old homes, playing piano, cooking, and talking/learning anything involving history.
